#This program is designed to grab usb controller inputs and convert them into commands
#	for a connected Arduino Mega2560 to turn into motor PWM signals.

#This program will not work without the Arduino also being configured with the
#	associated Motor_Control.ino file using the Arduino IDE.

#This program is also designed to use the Logitech Game Controller
#	The controller uses the left axis for forward/reverse movement,
#		and the right axis for left/right turns

#If another controller is used, the Controller_Mapping program can
#	be used to map the button/axis layout of the controller

#This program uses the provided Arduino, which is named in the system
#To name another device, use the following Linux commands while your device is connected
#	dmesg | grep tty
#		The above command lists the ports of the currently connected devices
#	udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyACM0 --attribute-walk
#		This command lists the attributes of your connected device
#		ttyACM0 is the port your device is currently connected in, change it accordingly
#	sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/11-usb-serial.rules
#		This command opens a file with gedit
#		The file creates a symbolic link with listed device
#		Edit the file with information from the udevadm command
#		Example: The file used by the current system has the following information
#			KERNELS=="1-2", ATTRS{serial}=="5583832363535120A161", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2341", SYMLINK+="Main_Arduino"
#				The  SYMLINK is what you wish to name your device as
#	sudo udevadm trigger
#		This command loads the file into the system
#		Reconnect your device after running this command
#	ls /dev
#		If you look through the alphabetized list and see your device name, it worked

# The key functions are:
#	sendToArduino(str) which sends the given string to the Arduino. The string may 
#					   contain characters with any of the ascii values 0 to 255
#
#	recvFromArduino()  which returns an array.
#						 The first element contains the number of bytes that the Arduino said it included in
#							 message. This can be used to check that the full message was received.
#						 The second element contains the message as a string


# the overall process followed by the demo program is as follows
#   open the serial connection to the Arduino - which causes the Arduino to reset
#   wait for a message from the Arduino to give it time to reset
#	initialized the connected controller using pygame
#   loop through the current input states of the controller
#		generate commands based on the input states
#		send the commands to the Arduino
#		wait for a reply and display it on the PC

# the message to be sent to the Arduino starts with < and ends with >
#	the message content comprises two integers
#	the numbers are sent as their ascii equivalents

# receiving a message from the Arduino involves
#	waiting until the startMarker is detected
#	saving all subsequent bytes until the end marker is detected
